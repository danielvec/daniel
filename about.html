  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm Daniel. I'm a self-taught developer with an analytical background. 
  I love to work with data and solve problems.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I've spent the past ~5 years doing research and development work in the
  Pharmaceutical industry. What really drives me in my work is solving problems and
  learning new and better ways to accomplish tasks. As a data enthusiast, my 
  programming journey began with tinkering around with Python and the Pandas 
  module. Last January I began working through the Ruby on Rails path of 
  The Odin Project, a project-focused curriculum, and I've thoroughly enjoyed it!</p>
